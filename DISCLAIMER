This project does not attempt to reverse engineer the WhatsApp API or
attempt to reimplement any part of the WhatsApp client. Any communication
between the user and WhatsApp servers is handled by WhatsApp Web itself;
this is just a native wrapper for WhatsApp Web, more akin to a browser
than any WhatsApp software.
